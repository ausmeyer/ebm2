# Must Know
--
<br>
- **Internal Validity**
--
  - Results of a study represent the truth of the study population
--
<br><br>
- **External Validity**
--
  - Results of a study apply to populations that aren't studied

# Types of Biases - My groupings

---

class: middle

# Biases of design or unseen variables

- **Selection bias**
  - Non-random partitioning of individuals into groups
--

- **Observer-expectancy**
  - Observer is unblinded and expects a particular outcome
--

- **Effect modification bias**
  - Magnitude of effect varies by third variable
  - __Can__ be eliminated by stratification
--

- **Confounding**
  - Unseen third variable is an underlying cause for correlation of two other variables
  - __Cannot__ be eliminated by stratification

---

class: middle

# Biases of information (measurement)

--
- **Recall bias**
  - Subjects with disease can recall exposures better than healthy subjects
--

- **Procedure bias**
  - Experimenters vary systematically in the way they do work
  - e.g. Experimenters don't follow the specified procedure
--

- **Instrument bias**
  - Instrument is broken
  - Instruments can also be things like surveys or __clerkship evaluations__
  - Just means instrument is not reliable

---

class: middle

# Biases of time and completion

- **Lead-time bias**
  - New test detects disease earlier
  - Survival appears improved with new test
--

- **Attrition bias**
  - Subjects systematically withdraw
  - Could be things like side effects or lack of improvement
--

- **Loss-to-follow up**
  - Subjects randomly do not report for scheduled followup

# Risk Ratio (RR)

                  No_Disease = c(70, 80)) 
dat$Total <- dat$Disease + dat$No_Disease

# Calculate Risk Ratio
RR <- (dat$Disease[1] / dat$Total[1]) / (dat$Disease[2] / dat$Total[2])

# Calculate CI
CI.h <- exp(log(RR) + 1.96*sqrt(1/dat$Disease[1] + 1/dat$Disease[2] + 1/(dat$Disease[1] + dat$No_Disease[1]) - 1/(dat$Disease[2] + dat$No_Disease[2])))
CI.l <- exp(log(RR) - 1.96*sqrt(1/dat$Disease[1] + 1/dat$Disease[2] - 1/(dat$Disease[1] + dat$No_Disease[1]) - 1/(dat$Disease[2] + dat$No_Disease[2])))

# Randomized control - gold standard

--

- This is widely considered the gold standard for clinical evidence
--
<br><br>
- Question: __Primary__ purpose of randomization?
--

- Answer: To eliminate __selection bias__
  - Selection bias (at the time of randomization) is eliminated if randomization is technically correct
--

<br><br>
- Question: Secondary goal of randomization?
--

- Answer: To help with confounding
  - Confounders are not necessarily eliminated even with perfect technical execution
--
<br><br>
- Can use relative risk because investigator knows prevalence of disease and prior exposures

---

class: middle

# Crossover trial - groups switch

<img src="figs/crossover.png" width="100%" />

<br>
- This post hoc analysis is overly simplified for real life
 
- This understanding is sufficient for boards
 
- Includes initial randomization

- Also, confounders reduced because a patient can serve as their own control

# Observational Studies

class: middle

# Cohorts form the next level of evidence
 
--

- Can use relative risk because investigator knows prevalence of exposure and disease
- Subjects vary by exposure status
- Can calculate incidence
--

- __Selection bias__ is the biggest problem
  - Investigator has infinite control over inclusion
--

- Other biases
  - Attrition, loss-to-follow up, confounding, Hawthorne
--

- Retrospective
  - Information bias

# Case-control trials measure chance of exposure given disease

<img src="figs/case_control.png" width="100%" />

---

class: middle

# Case-control forms the next level down from cohorts
--

- Must use odds ratio because investigator does not know prevalence of disease
--
- Subjects grouped by cases and controls
  - Measure __odds of exposure__ in case and control groups
--
- Significantly improved power and decreased resource requirements compared to cohorts 
  - Due to cases being selected at out set
--
- __Selection and Recall biases__ are the biggest problem
  - Selecting appropriate controls is __highly__ non-trivial
  - Sick people remember exposures (e.g. Melanoma patients stew about their sunburns)
--
  
- Also common
   - Information biases
--

- __Cannot calculate incidence or prevalence__

---

class: middle, center

# Cross-sectional trials measure exposure and disease simultaneously

<img src="figs/cross_sectional.png" width="100%" />

---

class: middle

# Cross-sectional study - next level

--

- __Quick, cheap, and easy__
  - Typically this is a starting point
--

- Can establish prevalence of disease
--

- Must use chi-squared or correlation for statistical test
--

- Subjects can be grouped by exposure and diease in to the 2x2 contingency
--
<br><br>
- __Cannot establish causation__
--

- Cannot calculate risk metrics
